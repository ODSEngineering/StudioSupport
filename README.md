# ODS Studio support, issue tracker and utilities

Support repository related to the **ODS Studio** modelling framework for **Blender**. This repo is intended to: 
* raise and track issues;
* disseminate helpful open-source utilities and snippets; and 
* store notes for documentation, tips and tricks

## To raise an issue (or feature request)

Feature requests and issues are raised through the same method.  To do so simply:
1. Click on the "Issues" tab at the top of the page (next to the "Code" tab)
2. Click on the "New Issue" button to create a new issue.
3. Leave a detailed comment relating to the issue or feature request.  
  * Please include screenshots where applicable to help communicate the issue.  
  * For feature requests, it is often helpful to take a screenshot and then mark it up in Paint (or Photoshop for bonus points) in order to communicate where you expect UI buttons or other input to be - or how you expect a feature to work.

## Utilities

Scripts and utilities are provided in the "utils" folder.  Please note that these scripts are provided as-is and without warranty or license.  Use them at your own risk!

## Notes

Notes, tips and tricks, workaround and other documentation that may not have made it into the core (or online) documentation are listed in the notes folder.  I will try to sort this into a logical structure, however you will likely want to use the Search feature in Github (at the top of the page) in order to find what you are looking for by keyword (bonus points if you clone the repo "grep" it).
